OneShot Only is the final project for the MSCH-220 course at Indiana University.
This 2D action game, built with Unity, combines a charming cartoon style with a slightly dark atmosphere. Players take on the role of the only magical being in the village, entrusted with the critical mission to save their people in a world where opportunities are scarce and danger is everywhere.

The title OneShot Only carries multiple meanings:

The hero has only one chance to save the villagers.
The character's limited number of magical attacks forces players to make every shot count.
During boss fights, shield break windows are extremely brief, often offering just a single opportunity to strike.
This project covers the complete production pipeline, from concept design and asset creation to gameplay development, scene transitions, and final polishing.

Development Process

Concept Design
Established a tense "one shot" gameplay theme, designing a character who stands alone as the village’s last hope. The visual style balances cuteness with a subtle sense of urgency.
Asset Production
Core sprites, including the main character and bosses, were created with AI assistance and refined manually to ensure clean transparency and Unity compatibility.
Backgrounds and UI elements were crafted to match the overall artistic tone of the game.
Gameplay Implementation
Built multiple playable scenes in Unity, implementing character movement, magic-based attacks, limited ammo systems, boss shield timing mechanics, and animated scene transitions using C#.
Background music dynamically shifts between scenes to enhance immersion and emotional impact.
Testing and Polish
Throughout development, issues such as sprite layering, scene loading errors, and boss fight balancing were addressed through iterative testing.
The final demo delivers a smooth and cohesive player experience.
